This is the source code of what used to be Palivovnik.cz - a fuel consumption / MPG tracking website for car enthusiasts.

I used to own a turbocharged Saab that liked to run on various mixtures of gasoline and ethanol and I needed to record fillups composed of multiple "phases", i.e. fillups where I mixed multiple types of
fuel during a single gas station visit. None of the MPG tracking services could do this without me having to first pre-compute the cost per litre and other values (thus losing the individual components of the fillup).
And so I decided to write my own service, documenting the process and technical details [on my blog](https://danielkvasnicka.tumblr.com/post/78551439614/chtel-bych-vam-predstavit-palivovnik) (in Czech language).

The service ran for a while and even had a few users besides me but eventually it stopped making sense for me to run it (especially because I sold the car I created it for and because, unsuprisingly, it wasn't anywhere near any kind of financial self-sustenance).

When browsing and judging the code please consider the fact that I started writing this at the beginning of 2013 :)
